# python-challenge
Description:
This is the homework assignment for week 3 of bootcamp. This week we have two different tasks to complete in Python. 

The first task deals with financial records of a company. The dataset has two columns, "date" and "profit/losses". I am tasked with manipulating this data in a few different ways.

In the second task, I am asked to help a small town modernize its voting process. The dataset has 3 columns, "Voter ID", "County" and "Candidate". Again, I am asked to manipulate the data in a few different ways.

Code:
All of the code for this challenge came from lessons we had in class. For the PyBank section, we built upon ideas that we learned in the VBA challenge.
