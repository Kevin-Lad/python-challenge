# python-challenge
# All of the code for this challenge came from ideas that we had in class
# For the PyBank section, we built upon ideas that we learned in the VBA challenge.
# We discussed two different ways to solve the PyPoll section. One being creating a counter for each candidate,
# or using a dicionary to complete the challenge. I wanted to submit the homework now, but I am also going to revisit
# the example code we were provided to solve this with a dictionary.
